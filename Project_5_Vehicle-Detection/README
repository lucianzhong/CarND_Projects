Vehicle Detection Project:

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
	1. Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a Linear SVM classifier
		Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector.
		Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
	2. Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
	3.Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of 			recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
	4.Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.
